# Fluffy Fish
Fluffy Fish is an exciting game that puts you in control of a cute puffer fish, navigating through the depths of the sea. It is a fresh take on the classic Flappy Bird game, with a fun underwater theme and engaging gameplay mechanics.

The objective of the game is simple: guide your fluffy fish through the obstacles by tapping the screen, and avoid hitting any of the obstacles in your way. You'll need to be quick and agile to succeed, as the obstacles are constantly changing and becoming more challenging as you progress through the game.

As you play, you can collect coins to unlock new clothing items for your fluffy fish. These clothing items not only add a fun and personalized touch to your character, but they also provide additional bonuses that can help you navigate through the levels more easily.

Fluffy Fish is a great game for players of all ages and skill levels. It's easy to pick up and play, but challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. With its cute graphics, engaging gameplay, and endless replayability, it's sure to become one of your favorite mobile games.
